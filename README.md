Rails Nested Plugin Generator
=============================

This is the Rails plugin generator modified to allow nested namespaces so folder hierarchy is properly created.

To make it work you just have to copy the content of this folder (you may exclude this README) to your $GEM_FOLDER$/railties-X.X.X/lib/rails/generators/rails/plugin_new/

TO-DO: Maybe not having to copy this folder into yout railties gem woud be nice, wouldn't it?
